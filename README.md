## Technologies Used

Our projects utilize various technologies commonly used in generative AI, including:

- Model as a service (Azure opanai,huggingface , gemini , and more)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Langchain and llamaindex
- GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
- VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)
- Transformer architectures
- And other relevant libraries and frameworks

## Project Structure

Each project in the vault includes:

- A detailed README explaining the project's purpose and functionality
- Comments in the code to explain key concepts and decisions
- Information on the dataset used (if applicable)
- Challenges faced during development and how they were overcome
